You can roll through
Just for the night tho
Careful when i move
Know that they might fold
She want nike want checks
Baby i write those
Lips all on my neck
That feel like white gold

[Verse 1]
Came from the D grew up ice cold
That's what i learned how to fight for
That’s what the gang always tight for
Ran up on us then they fell back
I had to go NFL that
Grabbing on me cause the whip fast
Switch lanes so quick gave her whiplash
(uh, yeah)
Back on the spot
They just hating cause we young and we hot
Wait till they see all they money we cop
Match the laces wit the chain and the watch
Pull up to it and they know who we are
Get green on the block i feel like h&r
She see me in public and know i'm star
Give me like 50 you know where we are

[Hook]
And i'm like you can roll through
Just for the night though
Careful when i move
Know that they might fold
She want nike want checks
Baby i write those
Lips all on my neck
That feel like whitegold

[Verse 2]
Booling on cambridge
They asking for favors
But never give payments
You know that that ain’t it
Got pair of pumas for like every occasion
Cocoa in the bread you know that it's cajun
Loco on a beat got these lame rappers
Shakin
Loco in my blood city all in my veins and
Ocho for a feat it ain't no conversations
Solo in the stu i don't never vacation
Locke right beside of me
Cardo gone ride for me
Come for my dawg
See a whole different side of me
Look to my left and my right like who stopping me
Bros never change up cause loyal they gotta be
I just might switch up
I had to lift my wrist up
I get my paper and twist up
Texting me like did miss her
But i gotta focus on the bag (yea)
Gotta focus on the bag baby
And i know you prolly feeling bad yea
But why you yelling getting mad baby
On the phone you tryna get me back yea
Like you the best i ever had baby
But i'd rather go run my check up cause this right here won't last baby
