<p> Kelly Slater is the greatest surfer of all time. He has a death grip on nearly every major record in the sport, including his 11 World Titles, 55 career victories, as well as being the youngest and oldest World Champion in menâ€™s history. He ushered in a new era of high-performance surfing when he arrived on the scene in 1990, incorporating intentional fin releases and a mix of aerial moves. </p> </div>
